The `us_flight_delays.csv` dataset contains US flight information, such as departure location, arrival location, cancellations, and delays of US airline companies. Select one of the airline companies (e.g. United Airlines), and using a significance level of $\alpha$ = 0.01, determine whether this airline company experiences significantly different delays compared to overall average delays. 

Based on your obtained p-value, the following can be inferred about United Airlines:

a) UA experiences significantly different delays

b) there is no statistically significant difference between UA delays and all airline company delays

c) UA experiences on average more delays 

d) UA experiences on average less delays

import scipy.stats as stats
import urllib.request

filename = 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_6777/datasets/us_flight_delays.csv.gz.csv'
urllib.request.urlretrieve(filename, "us_flight_delays.csv.gz")

df_flights = pd.read_csv('us_flight_delays.csv.gz')
all_delays = df_flights['DEPARTURE_DELAY'].dropna()

df_ua = df_flights.loc[df_flights['AIRLINE'] == 'UA']
ua_delays = df_ua['DEPARTURE_DELAY'].dropna()

# preloaded \alpha value
alpha = 0.01
```

`@sample_code`
```{python}
print(all_delays.mean())
print(ua_delays.mean())

# one sample t-test; compare population mean to one sample mean
popmean = all_delays.mean()
st, p = stats.ttest_1samp(ua_delays, popmean)

# use the obtained p-value and given significance level to assess whether you should reject or fail to reject the hypothesis
if (p > alpha):
    print('p-value > alpha, thus we fail to reject the NULL hypothesis.')
else: 
    print('p-value <= alpha, thus we reject the NULL hypothesis.')
```
